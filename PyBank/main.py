# The goal of this assignment is to read budget_data.csv, which has two columns of data: 'Date' and 'Profit/Losses'
# Analyze the records to calculate each of the following:
    # The total number of months included in the dataset
    # The net total amount of 'Profit/Losses' over the entire period
    # The average of the changes in 'Profit/Losses' over the entire period
    # The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    # The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
# Final script should print both the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
